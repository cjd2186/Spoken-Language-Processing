## üìÇ Repository Structure

 `Dialogue_Act_Recognition`
  Implements models to classify Switchboard Corpus Dialogue utterances based on their communicative intent (e.g., question, statement) using acoustic and lexical features and BERT encoder Embeddings. 

  `Emotion_Classification`  
  Focuses on detecting emotional states from speech data using prosodic/acoustic features and Multilayer Perceptron classifier. 

  `Speech_Feature_Extraction`  
  Provides tools for extracting relevant features from raw audio signals, such as MFCCs and pitch, for use in downstream task.
